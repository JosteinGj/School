The bootstrap in statistics

Idea use the data iself to get more info about a statistic, we used the same data to estimate the statistic


standard deviation of the sample median 

assume that mwe obsereve a random sample x1,2x ,x3,.. xn from an unknown probdist f, we are instereste in saying something abou bht e populatio median, thus we calculate the sample median ~x
	-> Q: how accuarte is this ~x as an estimator?

we want to find a std deviation



assume we knwo f the we can repeatedly take samplesa an d tcalculate the standard deviantion ot obtain an estimate.

ex normal distribution

	set.seed(123)
	n= 101 
	B= 1000
	estimator rep (NA,B)
	xs= rnorn(n)








moving from sim to boostrat (f unknown)
the botstrap method uses obser data to ext the imporical dist ^f that is each obs value of x is given prob 1/n

a bootstrap sample x1*, x2* ,x3* is a rand samp dawn from f^

a simple way to obtain the bostrap sampe is to deraw iwht replacement from x1, x2, .., xn

Note: our boostraps sample consist of n members of x1,x2,..,xn some appearing more than once, other appearing at all


we always need to sample the same amount of bootstrap variables as we have original values.



we then compare the sample median


we take the original median 

and then we take the bootstrap samples and take the median of that.

we then want to do this a lot of times.

Algorithm

Draw B boostraps sampse with replacement from original doata
2 evaluate the statuisitci of interest of the bootrsap sample to get the bth boostrap sample

estimabte the squared satndard deviation of all the bootstrap samples empirically.



bootstraping in multiple linear regression 

when we have several predictors in one observation we cant chop a value.




Bagging (module 8)
builds on bootstraping.
